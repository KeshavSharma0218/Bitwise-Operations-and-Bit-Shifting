# Bitwise-Operations-and-Bit-Shifting
This Java program performs various bitwise operations and bit shifting on integers. It supports the following operations:

NOT: Flips all the bits of a given integer.
AND (A), OR (O), XOR (X): Performs respective bitwise operations between two integers.
Shift Right (RS), Shift Left (LS): Shifts the bits of an integer by a specified amount.
Rotate Right (RC), Rotate Left (LC): Rotates the bits of an integer either to the right or left by a specified number of positions.
Features:
Supports a variety of bitwise operations: NOT, AND, OR, XOR.
Supports both arithmetic and logical shifts.
Performs bit rotation operations (both right and left).
Accepts multiple commands in sequence.
Instructions:
The program accepts commands in the format:

N num: Perform a NOT operation on num.
A num1 num2: Perform an AND operation between num1 and num2.
O num1 num2: Perform an OR operation between num1 and num2.
X num1 num2: Perform an XOR operation between num1 and num2.
RS shiftAmount num: Shift num to the right by shiftAmount.
LS shiftAmount num: Shift num to the left by shiftAmount.
RC shiftAmount num: Rotate num to the right by shiftAmount.
LC shiftAmount num: Rotate num to the left by shiftAmount.
Run the program and input commands one by one for each operation.
